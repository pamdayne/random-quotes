## Overview

Hi there, my name is Pam and I'm a frontend engineer by day. In my progamming life, I enjoy doing CSS for the most part. 

My main focus through this exercise is as a practice for myself to get in touch with plain vanilla Javascript. 

Honestly, I was really afraid to do anything Javascript. But with these kinds, I think I can move past that fear eventually.

Thanks to devchallenges.io for making these kind of exercises are fun to do. This is the first one I've done from them.

You can see the demo [here](https://rand-quoter.netlify.app/).

Though it may not seem a lot, but to myself, I learned about fetch(), setTimout() and forEach() functions. I have still so many things I need to learn and to be better at. 

I look forward to doing more of these challenges.
